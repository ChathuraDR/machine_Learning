In www.ebay.com site there's a bug related to querying the database. under Women's Clothing category there's a drop-down called T-Shirts. When someone clicks on an item in that drop down, it shows following message,

"The query must have at least a keyword, category ID, EPID (eBay Product ID), ISBN, event ID or UPC." 

This is given the users, pieces of information about the table's column name. 
In this report I'm introducing you to a bug I found on the relevant dropdown list. Please check the following links,
